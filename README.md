Automated Deployment Pipeline
Overview
This project involves the creation of a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using Jenkins, Docker, and AWS. The goal was to automate the deployment process, reduce manual interventions, and enhance the overall deployment efficiency.

 Features
- Automated build and deployment process.
- Integration with Jenkins for CI/CD.
- Docker for containerization of applications.
- Deployment on AWS infrastructure.

 Technologies Used
- Jenkins
- Docker
- AWS (EC2, S3, RDS)
- GitHub

 Impact
- Reduced deployment time by 40%.
- Increased deployment consistency and reliability.
Cloud Cost Optimization Tool

 Overview
This project focuses on optimizing cloud costs by building a tool to analyze and manage AWS expenditures. The tool leverages AWS SDK and Python to provide insights into cloud usage and suggest optimizations.

 Features
- Analysis of AWS cost and usage data.
- Recommendations for cost-saving opportunities.
- Detailed reports on cloud spending.

 Technologies Used
- Python
- AWS SDK (Boto3)
- AWS Cost Explorer

Impact
- Achieved a 25% reduction in monthly cloud costs.
- Improved visibility into cloud spending.
 Containerized Application Deployment

 Overview
This project aimed to improve the scalability and maintainability of a legacy application by containerizing it using Docker and deploying it on a Kubernetes cluster.

 Features
- Containerization of legacy application using Docker.
- Deployment and orchestration with Kubernetes.
- Improved scalability and maintainability of the application.

 Technologies Used
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- Helm
- AWS EKS

 Impact
- Enhanced scalability and ease of management.
- Improved resource utilization and application performance.
